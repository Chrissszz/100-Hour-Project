        <h2>About our haven</h2>
        <p>Whisker Haven was founded in 2010 by a group of cat lovers who wanted to provide a safe haven for stray and abandoned cats 
            in their community. Starting small in their own homes, they eventually raised enough funds to purchase a small building 
            which they renovated into a cozy and welcoming shelter for cats. Since then, Whisker Haven has become a respected and beloved animal shelter, 
            rescuing and rehoming thousands of cats with the help of dedicated staff and volunteers.

        <h2>First time cat owner?</h2>
        <p>As a new cat owner, it's important to know that cats are independent creatures with their own personalities, and they require some special 
            care to keep them happy and healthy. They need a balanced diet of high-quality food, fresh water, and daily playtime to keep them physically 
            and mentally stimulated. It's important to provide them with a clean litter box and regular veterinary checkups to prevent health problems. 
            Cats also need a safe and comfortable place to sleep, scratch, and climb, so consider providing them with a scratching post, a cozy bed, 
            and some toys. Finally, be patient and give your new cat time to adjust to their new surroundings, and always treat them with kindness 
            and respect. With the right care and attention, your new cat can become a beloved and loyal companion for many years to come.
